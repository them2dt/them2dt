## ❤️Favorites
In my journey of coding sessions at 2AM and liters of coffee, i had some projects i really enjoyed working on. 

Here are some favorites.

- [Keymount](https://github.com/them2dt/keymount), a password vault without password. But with many useful tools.
- [History of the PC](https://github.com/them2dt/keymount), a group project with friends.
- [Pong](https://github.com/them2dt/pong), the timeless classic, made with PyGame.
